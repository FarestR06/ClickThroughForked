## What happened to the original?

> I haven't played Minecraft since 1.16, but I kept my mods updated because people wanted them. Unfortunately, Minecraft changed a lot of internals with 1.19.4...
> I currently don't have the time and energy to do this, so there won't be a 1.19.4 update in the forseeable future. Sorry for that to everybody who uses my mods. \

Welp, guess this means I need to fork it. And coincidentally, the mod reached End-Of-Life as I had forked it.

## What it does:
Place a sign or item frame on a chest. Now click the sign/frame. You just opened the chest. \
Yes, this mod (like the original) is that simple.

## Do you have permission?
Like the original, this mod has the MIT License; I think I should be fine.
